# Fake News Detection App

This project is a machine learning-powered **Fake News Detection** web application built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. It enables users to input news text and determine whether the content is likely to be **real** or **fake** based on a trained classification model.

## Overview

With the rise of misinformation across digital platforms, the need for automated content validation is more critical than ever. This app leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, TF-IDF vectorization, and a machine learning classifier to classify news as either genuine or potentially fake.

## Features

- Clean, responsive, and interactive web UI powered by **Streamlit**
- Real-time prediction for pasted or typed news content
- Custom styling for a pleasant user experience
- Efficient preprocessing using regex, stopwords removal, and stemming
- Easily extendable for retraining with updated datasets
